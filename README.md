# AI Maze Solver

A Python-based maze solver application built using Pygame.  
The project visually demonstrates pathfinding algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A* to find the shortest path in a randomly generated maze.

## Features
- Random maze generation
- Pathfinding algorithms:
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - A* Algorithm
- Animated agent movement
- Sound effect when path is found
- Interactive buttons (Start, Pause, Randomize, Undo, Redo)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pygame
- Data Structures (Queue, Stack, Priority Queue)

## How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Install pygame:
pip install pygame
3. Run the program:
python AiMazeSolver.py
